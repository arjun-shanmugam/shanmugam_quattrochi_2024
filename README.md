1. Obtain data
  -Census Tract Shapfiles: https://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/api/download/v1/items/4a8eb4fb3be44ed5a1eec28551b9f3b2/shapefile?layers=0

  -Crime Incident Reports: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system, then download crime reports data for each year from 2015 to 2023
  -Eviction Data: The underlying source dataset is public at MassCourts.org. It is however not downloadable from that domain in a research-ready way. Our research-ready dataset was produced by manually downloading case dockets over a period of several years. Massachusetts law makes it clear that names and addresses at MassCourts.org are not protected, but case law and pending legislation make it unclear whether our concentrated list of names and addresses suddenly would become protected. For this reason, out of an abundance of caution, we are limiting distribution to researchers with research intent. All reasonable applications will be accepted. We will facilitate transmission of addresses for reproduction. Please email hello@masslandlords.net to apply.
